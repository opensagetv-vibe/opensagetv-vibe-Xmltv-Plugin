# XMLTV Importer Modernization

## Version3.6 Standard-plugin boundary

`xmltv.XMLTVStandardPlugin` implements the stock `sage.SageTVPlugin` interface;
the existing `xmltv.XMLTVImportPlugin` still implements guide discovery/import.
`ImporterRegistration` uses only Get/Set/RemoveServerProperty through the
supported SageTV API. It registers an empty importer only, never guesses that
a nonempty third-party class is obsolete, journals previous-value ownership,
and restores only an unchanged registration it owns. Existing XMLTV settings
remain administrator-owned; no multi-importer capability is claimed.

The Configure screen stages new provider fields and requires an explicit Save
before creating `vibe-plugin.xmltv.properties`. Existing provider files, unknown
managed-file keys, legacy/v2 IDs and database state are preserved. Invalid IDs,
duplicate provider IDs, stale external edits and unowned files are rejected.
Reload acknowledges external edits without an import or lineup selection.
Profiles seed only missing files; example providers remain outside discovery.

An installable SageTV Standard-plugin descriptor/package replaces the old
manual-only distribution. JAR/classes/resources and ZIP timestamps are pinned,
class major52 is checked, and package validation rejects foreign Sage classes,
unsafe paths, duplicate entries and non-resource/private content. Stock-JAR
lifecycle tests are separate from the parser/guide-mapping tests and the real
stock plugin-manager integration. There is no Core auto-discovery dependency.

## Scope

Version 3.4 modernizes the importer without changing the default legacy Show-ID
strategy or its SageTV EPG plugin class. It continues to target Java 8 bytecode
and is compiled/tested on OpenJDK 11 in the unified Ubuntu 26 build environment.

## Reliability contract

`XMLTVImportPlugin.updateGuide()` now returns `false` when a required stage
fails. Feed acquisition, secure validation, parsing, channel/show/series/airing
database calls, and `run.before` execution contribute to one `ImportResult`.
`setLineup()` is called only after every configured source completes without a
failure. Java `Error` instances are not converted into a false success.

This intentionally changes the historical behavior where broad exception
handlers could log an error, install a partial lineup, and still return success.

## Feed acquisition

`FeedDownloader` handles local paths, `file:`, HTTP, and HTTPS sources. It adds:

- bounded connect/read time, maximum decoded bytes, and redirect count;
- gzip detection by content rather than filename alone;
- validation of HTTP status and redirect targets;
- conditional requests using ETag and Last-Modified metadata;
- temporary-file writes followed by atomic replacement when supported; and
- cache preservation on failure without importing that stale cache as success.

Credentials and URL queries are redacted from configuration/log output.

## XML containment

`SecureXmlReader` creates the SAX reader used for both validation and import.
Secure processing is enabled. XMLTV's common `xmltv.dtd` declaration is
accepted, but external general entities, external parameter entities, external
DTD loading, and external DTD/schema access are disabled. A rejecting entity
resolver is installed as defense in depth. Error and fatal SAX callbacks
propagate. Per-element accumulated text is bounded.

The optional invalid-character filter remains supported, but it no longer
weakens the parser security configuration.

## Extracted boundaries

- `XmltvConfiguration`: typed, bounded configuration and redacted diagnostics.
- `FeedDownloader`: deterministic source acquisition and HTTP cache behavior.
- `SecureXmlReader` / `XmltvParser`: one hardened parser construction path.
- `XmltvDateParser`: strict, immutable `java.time` timestamp/date parsing.
- `ExternalCommandRunner`: drained output, timeout, exit status, and teardown.
- `ChannelMapper`: station-ID and channel-number calculations.
- `ProgrammeMapper`: safe season/episode/part bounds and airing flags.
- `SageGuideWriter`: narrow adapter around the SageTV public guide API.
- `ShowIdGenerator` / `ShowIdAudit`: production identity and migration audit.

Importer parsing state is instance-owned rather than static. Configuration
files are re-read for provider discovery, relative includes resolve relative to
their parent, duplicate/cyclic includes terminate, and invalid providers are
skipped without hiding valid providers.

## Mapping corrections

- Preferred-language title, subtitle, and description selection is supported.
- Movie ratings such as `PG` and `PG-13` are no longer discarded by a TV-only
  check; mapped TV ratings also populate SageTV's parental-rating field.
- The previously unreachable `<subtitles>` mapping now emits the subtitle flag.
- `<previously-shown start="...">` is parsed and retained.
- Offset-free 12/14-digit XMLTV timestamps are interpreted in the server time
  zone instead of rejecting otherwise valid provider data.
- Short season/episode values and multipart values cannot overrun fixed fields.
- A repeated channel across multiple configured feeds remains valid and appears
  once in the final lineup.
- Different channel IDs that collide under the historical station-ID arithmetic
  receive deterministic provider-scoped fallback IDs; the original channel
  keeps its established ID and every station remains in the lineup.

Default channel station-ID arithmetic is preserved, including legacy decimal
channel behavior, because changing it would detach an established lineup.

## Tests

`scripts/build.sh` compiles production sources with `javac --release 8` and
runs all tests before packaging. Coverage includes:

- missing feeds, malformed/truncated XML, safe standard XMLTV DTD declarations,
  hostile inline/external entities, rejected SageTV writes, and the invariant
  that failed imports never call `setLineup`;
- local/HTTP/gzip acquisition, redirects, conditional 304 responses, server
  errors, byte limits, read timeouts, and cache preservation;
- strict timestamps with multiple UTC offsets, offset-free local timestamps,
  and invalid calendar values;
- command success, output draining, non-zero exit, and timeout termination;
- provider add/delete reload, relative includes, and invalid configurations;
- rating/language/previously-shown/subtitle/season/episode metadata;
- multiple-source channel retention, deterministic station-ID collision
  fallback, and a generated 500-channel lineup;
- legacy/v2 identity compatibility, persistence, collision detection, and the
  dry-run migration audit; and
- existing channel-logo normalization and malformed-entity regressions.

The plugin JAR is written to `output/packages/XMLTVImportPlugin.jar`; individual
logs are written to `output/test-results/`.

## Version 3.5 profiles

Reusable format profiles are optional implicit includes located in the SageTV
server root. Legacy files without `xmltv.profile` take the unchanged code path.
The resolver keeps ordinary include chains and applies explicit provider-file
values last. Automatic generation writes a provider-named profile and updates
the selection atomically while leaving the original settings in place. Tests
cover legacy behavior, all precedence levels, missing profiles, include cycles,
case-insensitive profile selection, safe names, non-overwrite behavior, and
temporary-file cleanup.
